# Analog Volume Expander

**Real-time audio volume expander to enhance the dynamic range of audio signals.**

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an **Analog Volume Expander**, which enhances the dynamic range of audio signals by applying upward expansion. It is tailored for applications like recording, broadcasting, and live sound systems.

### Key Features
- Real-time signal processing with minimal latency.
- User-configurable threshold and expansion ratio.
- Efficient **Control Voltage Processor** and **Voltage-Controlled Amplifier (VCA)**.
- Integrated notch filter to eliminate power line interference.
- Dual-layer PCB design and custom 3D-printed enclosure.
